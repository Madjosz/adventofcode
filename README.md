# Advent of Code
This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

I first discovered these puzzles on 2020-12-16 and it took me four days to catch up starting from the 1st of December.

Now I will add more and more solutions starting from 2015.

# Inputs

Expected values of unit tests are bound to the inputs provided to my user. They have be put under `src/main/resources/de/madjosz/adventofcode/y####/day##.txt`. As the creator Eric Wastl [doesn't want to have all the inputs flying around](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7lesj5/comment/drlt9am/) I excluded them from this repository.

# Leaderboard

Haha, the puzzles unlock at 06:00 a.m. for me and I am writing Java, so most likely I will never be on any public AoC leaderboard...
